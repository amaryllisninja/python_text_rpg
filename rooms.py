roomDescriptions = {
    0:'''This room looks old, but well maintained. The wooden floors have seen many feet and
the sliding rice paper doors look like they have been repaired many times. But
while it looks as if it has been abused, it has an air of quiet dignity about it.
This is a respected and honorable room.
To the North, East, South, and West are hallways.''',
    1:'''A quiet, dusty hallway. It does not look as if anyone has been here in a long time.
To the North and South are hallways. To the West is the Dojo.''',
    2:'''A quiet, dusty hallway. It does not look as if anyone has been here in a long time.
To the North the is the Dojo. To the East is the kitchen. To the West are hallways. You can
leave the Dojo to the South.''',
    3:'''A quiet, dusty hallway. It does not look as if anyone has been here in a long time.
To the North are the sleeping quarters and to the South is the kitchen. To the East is the
Dojo.''',
    4:'''A quiet, dusty hallway. It does not look as if anyone has been here in a long time.

To the North and West are hallways.''',
    7:'''This kitchen looks untouched, with thick layers of dust everywhere. But, everything
looks tidy and nicely put away.
To the North and East are hallways.''',
    8:'''This is a quiet, calm room. Rolled up futons line the walls of the room, covered
with dust from lack of use. Being in here makes you yawn.
To the East and South are hallways.''',
    9:'''You are on a little path outside of the Dojo. The Dojo to the North looks worn out
and tired. It was clearly once a place of great reknown, but it is now a mere shadow of its
former glory. To the South is a quiet forest trail.''',
    10:'''This is a trail well-worn by the passage of many feet. It looks as though it is less
traveled, now, as small bushes and vines are growing to cover the path you're on.
To the North is the path outside of the Dojo. To the South is a small town.''',
    11:'''You find yourself at the Northern entrance to a small town. It is almost cliched with
how quaint it is. Townsfolk wander around on the streets, going about their daily business.
To the North is a quiet forest path. To the East is an Alchemist shop. To the South is the
center of town. To the West is the Nothern residences.''',
    12:'''A musty, dusty little shop with a grinning alchemist standing behind a counter. There
are all sorts of oddities and trinkets here. One wall of the shop is covered with glittering,
glistening, murky, slithery, or clear potions. Being here makes you uncomfortable.
The exit is to the West.''',
    13:'''This is a clean little shop, filled with common wares, such as rope, daggers, and
clothing. The bearded shopkeeper beams at you from behind the counter.
The exit is to the West.''',
    14:'''You are at the center of this little town. The sparkling fountain at the center looks
cool and refreshing. The water is almost blue with how clear it is.
To the North is the Nothern entrance of town. To the East is the General Store. To the South is
the Southern entrance of town. To the west is the Western residences.''',
    15:'''There are quaint little cottages all along this side of town. You see children running
around and playing, parents watching them through the windows, and little flowers blooming
everywhere.
To the East is the Northern entrance of town. To the South is the Western residences.''',

everywhere.
To the North are the Northern residences. To the East is the center of town. To the South are the
Southern residences. To the West are the town gardens.''',
    17:'''This bakery smells wonderful. Shelves line the walls, covered almost to collapsing with
fresh bread, muffins, cakes, and other such bready delights. The baker behind the counter looks
surprisingly thin for being constantly surrounded by the bread wonders he makes.
To the West is the exit.''',
    18:'''You find yourself at the Southern entrance to a small town. It is almost cliched with
how quaint it is. Townsfolk wander around on the streets, going about their daily business.

of town. To the West is path to the moutains.''',

everywhere.
To the North are the Western Residences. To the East is the Southern entrace to town.''',
    20:'''This gravel path crunches under your feet. You can hear the sounds of the town, but
just barely.
To the North is the Southern entrance to town. To the South is a lonely path. To the West is the path to the mountains.''',
    21:'''Before you and to the West is a lofty mountain range. The mountains are coated with
snow, looking cold and gray. The sight of these make you shiver just thinking about being up
there.
To the East is the path outside of town. To the West are the mountains.''',
    22:'''Butterflies, flowers, and vines fill this little garden. It looks as though this is
lovingly taken care of by the whole town. Underneath the flowers and vines, you spot small toys,
long since forgotten by their young owners.
To the East are the Western residences.''',
    23:'''An air of calm settles on you as you stand in this shrine. This is the only place in
the entire Dojo that isn't covered in dust. It's almost as though there are diligent souls who
continue to maintain the shrine, long after their passing.
To the South is the Northern Hallway.''',
    24:'''As you walk along, you hear nothing but the sounds of nature. While quiet and peaceful,
you can't help but feel a bit lonesome.

    25:'''A wide, expansive field stretches around you in either direction, while the path you
are on goes North and South.''',
    26:'''A wide, expansive field stretches around you in either direction, while the path you
are on goes North and South.''',
    27:'''You are on a narrowing path, surrounded on either side by trees. The air seems
heavier and the light dimming as you walk.
To the North is the field. To the South is a dark forest.''',
    28:'''You find yourself at the entrance to a deep, dark forest. Peering inside, you can see
that the light is almost non-existant. The path seems to disappear into the forest.
To the South is the Forest of the Lost. To the North is a wooded path.''',
    29:'''You find yourself surrounded by trees, vines, and brambles. You can't tell from which
way you came or which way you should go. There is barely any light and you have lost any signs of a path.
You are hopelessly lost.''',
    30:'''You find yourself surrounded by trees, vines, and brambles. You can't tell from which
way you came or which way you should go. There is barely any light and you have lost any signs of a path.
You are hopelessly lost.''',
